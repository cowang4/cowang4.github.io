I used to wonder why looking back at a picture pulls on my heartstrings less
than seeing the view through my own eyes. Why does a sight seem like the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen when you take a picture of it, but looking at
someone else's most amazing view is just nice? Why are pictures fundamentally
worse than the view I'm taking the picture of? Here's an example:

I used to think that it was the medium of the picture that made it worse. That
somehow viewing an image on a screen or printing it out on a 4 by 6 piece of
paper made it worse. I thought that my own two eyes saw clearer on top of the
mountain then at my desk.

That can't be true though, picture, screen, and printing quality is so good
that it looks just as real as it would _au naturel_. The content of the image
is the same. So what is it then that makes a view so special that I pull out
a camera and try to save it? 

I think that it is the context of an image that makes it great. It is the
emotional state that I'm in that makes the view so special. It is the act of
taking a trip to a fantastic place so different from home that fills me with
wonder, more than the visual stimulus alone. Awe of the beauty of nature has
just as much to do with the place of mind as it does the place of body. Hiking
and sweating and exploring only to find a unique place like I've never seen
before creates such a powerful feeling. Looking at that place in a picture
has no chance of replicating that feeling, only a part of it.
