It's starting to look like the winners of the 2016 Presidential Primarys
will be Donald Trump for the Red side and Hillary Clinton for the blue. Though
many of us wish a certian-other-person-Senator-Bernie-Sanders-not-to-name-names would
win, [he probably won't](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/delegate-targets/).
So, general election for the mighty position of President of the United States.
The first time I get to use my constitutional right to vote in a general
election, and it's between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. :grimacing:
Luckily for the population of this planet, the Donald probably won't win.
Unfortunatly for him, it seems like most of the people who are going to vote
for him in the general election, have voted for him in the primaries. In Nate
Silver's words, "[Trump will have a hard time turning blue states red in
November](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-will-have-a-hard-time-turning-blue-states-red-in-november/)." Not to mention the fact that Trump is [immensely unpopular with women]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/TrumpWomen.png). Hillary is much more electable than Trump. 

All this media coverage of Trump means that we might forget that Hillary Clinton is poised to be the next President of the United States, and in doing so become the first-ever female President of the United States.
I'll take a brief moment to point out that the U.S. is late to the
women-as-leaders-of-countries-party; Mongolia 1953, Argentina 1974,
[etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elected_and_appointed_female_heads_of_state).
Being a female President doesn't make Hillary more effective at being
President, but it does symbolize a big step in the right direction for
empowering women. Women are currently CEOs of 4.4% of Fortune 500 companies,
that's twenty-two out of five-hundred [src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_CEOs_of_Fortune_500_companies). It would do a lot for third wave feminism if Hillary Clinton won.
Plus, wouldn't it be fun to make jokes about President Bill Clinton being
a first lady?

tl;dr Hillary might win the election, yay women! :us:
